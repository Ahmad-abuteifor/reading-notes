# What is HTML 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
**HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements,**


# The  wireframes
** What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?**

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

** Examples of wireframes**

Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:

Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page:   

 

<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

# Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

-<article>  
-<aside>  
-<details>  
-<figcaption>  
-<figure>  
-<footer>  
-<header>    
-<main>  
-<mark>  
-<nav>  
-<section>  
-<summary>  
-<time>
