# JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

# JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores  
     
1.dollar signs.  
2.Names must begin with a letter  
3.Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)  
4.Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)  
5.Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

# an example :

var $$$ = "Hello World";  
var $ = 2;  
var $myMoney = 5;


# Operator
The Assignment Operator (=)  
The Arithmetic Operator(-,+,*,/)  
the compartion operator (==,<,>,<=,>=)

# for example
var x = 5 + 2 + 3;
