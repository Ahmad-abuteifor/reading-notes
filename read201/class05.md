JPEG , PNG and GIF



Use **JPEG** format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth

**PNG** is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.

**GIF** images support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette as transparent (index transparency).
