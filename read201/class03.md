# lists

HTML provides us with
three different types:
. Ordered lists    
. Unordered lists    
. Unordered lists    

The ordered list is created with  
the <ol> element   
Ordered lists use numbers.  

Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag  
and a closing </li> tag.  


<ul>  
The unordered list is created  
with the <ul> element. and also the same with <ol>
 Unordered lists use bullets.
