# Structure
structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document 

**The Structure of** is done by   
1. html   
2. css   
3. js   


**HTML** : is stands for HyperText Markup
Language. using  tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.  
 Attributes require a name and a value.

## The Evolution of HTML
different versions of HTML.  
1. HT ML 4
Re leased 1997  
2. XHT ML 1.0
Re leased 2000  
3. HT ML5
Re leased 2000  

Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
**DOCTYPE** declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using

**Comments in HTML** 
If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser 
 <!-- comment goes here -->  


**ID Attribute**: It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page.

**Class Attribute**:rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page


**Inline Elements**: Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements

Examples of inline elements are:  
1. <a>     
2. <b>  
3. <em>  
4. <img>

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.  

<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.  

 The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.  

Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

**Headers & Footers**
<header> <footer> 

The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.  


The** <nav> **element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.    


The **<article>** element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.    


The**<section>** element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading
