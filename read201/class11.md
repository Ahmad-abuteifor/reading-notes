Using CSS**

using the <img>
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:  
1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
(such as the small class in our
example).  
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.  


**Centering images
Usin**
On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center  

**Background Images

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box. in defferint size
