# The Document Object Model (DOM)

specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page

the attribute nodes :is the opening tags of html   

text nodes :is the once you have accessed an elemant 

**WORKING WITH
THE DOM TREE**: 
 Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.  
2.  Use its text content, child elements, and attributes    



**ACCESS THE ELEMENTS**
1. SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL
ELEMENT NODE  
2. SELECT MULTIPLE
ELEMENTS (NODELISTS)  
3. TRAVERSING BETWEEN
ELEMENT NODES  

When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a
Nodelist   

to selecte elemant :
using IDattribute , NODELISTS and CSS SELECTORS 


Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .  


**REMOVING ELEMENTS VIA
DOM MANIPULATION**

1. STORE THE ELEMENT
TO BE REMOVED IN A
VARIABLE  
2. STORE THE PARENT OF
THAT ELEMENT IN A
VARIABLE  
3. REMOVE THE ELEMENT
FROM ITS CONTA INING
