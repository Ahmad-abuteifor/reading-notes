# What is CSS?
**CSS**  allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

# What is CSS for?
As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

External styles are defined within the 
<link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

"mystyle.css"
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
