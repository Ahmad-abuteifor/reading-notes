# how can we use props in react 

React has a different approach to data flow & manipulation than other frameworks

What is Props?
**React**is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and
 the way to pass data between components is by using props.

Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

## Using Props in React  
. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)  
. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props  
. Finally, render the Props Data

**1st Step**: Defining Attribute & Data

we can do the same for React components. We can define our own attributes & assign values with interpolation { }

**2nd Step**: Passing Data using Props

Passing props is very simple. Like we pass arguments to a function, we pass props into a React component and props bring all the necessary data.  


**Final Step**: Rendering Props Data  
Alright so far, we have created an attribute and its value, then we passed it through props but we still can’t see it because we haven’t rendered it yet.


 


## What is a Component?

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. 

A component can have three different views − object-oriented view, conventional view, and process-related view.

1. Object-oriented view  

2. Conventional view  

3. Process-related view  





**Object-oriented view**  

A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes.
 Each problem domain class (analysis) and 
infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation



**Conventional view**
It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic.



**Principles of Component−Based Design**

- The software system is decomposed into reusable, cohesive, and encapsulated component units.  

- Each component has its own interface that specifies required ports and provided ports; each component hides its detailed implementation.  
 
- A component should be extended without the need to make internal code or design modifications to the existing parts of the component.
