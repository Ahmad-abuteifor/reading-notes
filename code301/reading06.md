# NODE.JS

## What Is Node.js?
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

*Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine*

**what is Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine**
 open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers
 like : 1. Brave  
 2. Opera  
 3. Vivaldi.  

 ## what dose mean a JavaScript runtime 
 This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

 ## what is npm:
 npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

## the 6 reasons for pair programming: 
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness





**i think that the most reasons is**
  Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work



**How does pair programming work?**
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
