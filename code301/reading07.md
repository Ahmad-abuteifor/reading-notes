about the article in 201 i have read it befor

### Who is Roy Fielding?
 He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

 ### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines. 

e need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine 




### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
 
is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

**What does a GET do?**

The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed.


**What does a POST do?**
post what you want in url for the machine to understand 

What does PUT do?

it like put cup and oppset of dellet 



**Did you get your API key?** 
i have just on of them the other dont give me any thing
