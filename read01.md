# The  Basic  of Markdown
 
## What is Markdown?
is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document;
formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images, 
and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in

### Some of Examples:
1.if yo uwant to Bold some words you need to put the syntax (** ** )  
2.if yo uwant to italic  some words you need to put the syntax ( * * )   
3.if yo uwant to Headers some words you need to put the syntax ( # )  


#### about the links and the img :
* for img : ![Alt Text](url)
* for Links : [ alt text   ](  url  )


# when you want to make a list :
* **order list** 
    use the numbers like (1,2,3,4)
* **unorder list**
     use the syntax (*) or (-)
