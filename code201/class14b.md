# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team 


google data-saturated age enables us to 
examine our work habits and office quirks with 
a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.




 Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.
 
 
 
 
  **‘‘We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity,’’**
  
  
   says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information. ‘‘All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don’t even notice, and figure out why some people are so much more effective
 than everyone else.’

Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: 
How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. They studied 

how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.

After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most.  

Team A is composed of people who are 
all exceptionally smart and successful.
 When you watch a video of this group working, 
you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do.   



We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’


the technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.
 And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, today’s 
winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.

The paradox, of course, is that Google’s
 intense data collection and number crunching have
 led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams
, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
